## 1772047141-thread.json - find replace only (not that useful)

ok yeah find replace but still, sometimes fun to use this... especially if there's any ambiguity about a single use case

## 1772047348-thread.json - rearrange each condition (much more useful)

## 1772047697-thread.json - reverse rearrange and go back to `in` instead of `==`

## 1772048031-thread.json - return early
