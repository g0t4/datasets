I wasn't feeling that creative with naming so I asked gptoss to extract the function (forcing gptoss to name it)
- made it a local function (good!)
- readability wise, yes it did actually help with the return on its own line... single line if/return is easy to miss (I rarely do this)... anyways note how I asked it to make the code readable and it didn't stop at the function definition
