this is why I love AI =>
  map Language Server's MessageType => vim.log.levels (mind numbing to even compare the numbers myself!)
  and gptoss got 4 of 5 right and the missing MessageType.DEBUG(5) would map to Info which is fine!

and in this case not even RAG matches could help out! gptoss had to do this "From memory" on both ends!
