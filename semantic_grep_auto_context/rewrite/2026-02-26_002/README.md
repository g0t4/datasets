I applied the filtering to the wrong service object!
=> just ask the model to correct it! (ambiguous but did well with it!)

FYI one conundrum I have, verifying these changes, especially when I didn't commit first
- SO, going forward, consider a tmp commit (tooling could automate this!)
- review diff of tmp commit vs changes
- consider reviewing changes when asking for these types of rewrites...
  - be mindful that rewrite+review very well may take longer than just rewriting myself
    however, keep in mind, having the model rewrite is like a second set of eyes
    perhaps I could also just ask the model to check my work (tmp commit vs my manual changes)
