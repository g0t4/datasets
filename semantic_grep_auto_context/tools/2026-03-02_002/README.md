ask to use tools to qwen3.5-122b-a10b to summarize this repo
- felt fast! 100+ tokens/sec! is great for a bigger model!
- missed that this has neovim config!!! (said mostly hammerspoon which is probably true as far as lua file counts)

## tool use observations
- judicious use of limits on commands `| head -30`
- didn't use semantic_grep
