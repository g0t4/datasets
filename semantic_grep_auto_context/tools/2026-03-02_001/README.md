darn... qwen3.5-122b-a10b tried using command_line w/ mode=executable...
 - not a big deal if one off
 - but if it recurs, then I do need to address this in my run commands server
     I have for a while now felt like I should just have:
       argv
       command_line
       and ditch mode=shell/executable


       BUT that doesn't mean I need to, gptoss120b doesn't have trouble using it AFAICT I can't think of one time it did it wrong
