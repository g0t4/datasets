# When vLLM is launched with `--media-io-kwargs '{"video": {"num_frames": -1}}'`,
# video frame sampling can be configured via `extra_body` (e.g., by setting `fps`).
# This feature is currently supported only in vLLM.
#
# By default, `fps=2` and `do_sample_frames=True`.
# With `do_sample_frames=True`, you can customize the `fps` value to set your desired video sampling rate.
